# Polar-Ice-Melting-Prediction
Hybrid Model: Utilize a combination of SARIMA, LSTM, and Random Forest algorithms to accurately predict the onset of polar ice melt and freeze patterns.
Data-Driven Insights: Analyze historical climate data (1979-2022) to forecast future ice behavior and identify regions most impacted by these changes.
Impact Assessment: Provide actionable insights for policymakers to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels and disrupted ecosystems.
